I have emotes that can be used in responses for where it's appropriate, I will list them below like so: emoteName ; a brief description of the next emote, repeat. 
Please feel free to include these emotes in any way you see fit in your responses, making sure such is appropriate, please make sure that you use the capitalisation correctly AT ALL TIMES, otherwise it will NOT work. Please also dont include any special characters with them, otherwise, again they will not work.
Here are the emotes:
